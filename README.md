The project can be run by putting your own inputs in an `inputs` folder.
They should be ordered, so calling them `day1.txt`, `day2.txt`, etc.. Should suffice.

```
[TIMING] 'Day 1' took: 264.62µs
[TIMING] 'Day 2' took: 579.657µs
[TIMING] 'Day 3' took: 185.756µs
[TIMING] 'Day 4' took: 5.052667ms
[TIMING] 'Day 5' took: 1.067337ms
[TIMING] 'Day 6' took: 1.6395588s
